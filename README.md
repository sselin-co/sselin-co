### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a software developer with a passion for accessibility, fullstack development, and minimalist design.

Currently, I am employed as a Junior Web Developer at Osler, Hoskin, and Harcourt LLP, a leading national law firm. In April 2022, I will be a graduate of the computer science program at UBC Okanagan in Kelowna BC, Canada. As part my work at Osler, I'm pursuing a Microsoft M365 Associate Cloud Developer certification.
